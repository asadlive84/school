# School management application
- golang
- grpc
- gin 
- react

Feature:
1. upload students by CSV file

In this project I created a project with grpc, go and gin, just to learn how microservices work. It is a fun and serious project and it has three parts
One is the API part and two are the service part.
The service parts are - auth-svc, student-svc

The client will communicate with the api part and the api part will communicate with the service. The client will not connect directly to the service.

For now, the data can be saved in json format using postman by running this project.


## Installation

I will create doc for details
